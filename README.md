# neurohackathon

Work done with [Sumit](https://github.com/sumitsk), [Swami](https://github.com/swami1995) and [Shubham](https://github.com/shubhamag) on the [Yttri Lab](https://www.bio.cmu.edu/laboratories/yttri/) Dataset which consisted of neuron spike activity from 255 neurons in 2 mice.

We predicted movement occurrence, amplitude and velocities from the neuron data. All that code, along with a lot of things that did not work, is in this repository.
