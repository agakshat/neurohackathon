##Description of code filenames and the code in them##

neuro.ipynb : Jupyter notebook with code for data analysis and visualizatons , PCA analysis, correlation of waveforms,

                occurences of reaches and rewards

nn_regress.py : Feed forward NN to regress ot classify depths of a neuron from it's neural activity

nn_classify.py : Feed forward NN to regress ot classify whether a reach will start in a given timestep


cnn*.py : Classifying the specific reache occurences without binning using a CNN. Also includes files to interpret the code using gradients.
cnn_regression regresses amplitudes of joystick data

cluster_neurons : heirachical clustering of neurons based on firing instances

preprocess_tss and tss_to_binary : preprocessing of raw data

regression.py : Code to regress amplitude and velocity of joystick using neuron firing patterns.

classifiers.py : Code for several classic ML algorithms like Random forest, SVM, naive Bayes to predict reach occurences from neural firing patterns

rnn.py : Code to Use a LSTM to predict reach occurences from neural firing activity to model time dependencies
